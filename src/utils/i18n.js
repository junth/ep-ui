      usingEveripediaSixBody: "Everipedia takes pride in being an inclusive platform with a simple onboarding process. That said, there are a few editorial-related policies / do’s and don’t’s we believe everyone should follow. DO: Write on anything crypto-related: Everipedia is to bring blockchain knowledge to the world and knowledge onto the blockchain, so editors should only write on crypto-related topics. Write in a third-person, objective tone: because Everipedia is a knowledge base, one of the precedents we have set is to think from the perspective of an academic scholar. When editing an Everipedia article, ask yourself, “Would this be considered an objective resource if someone else read this?” Cite your sources where needed: It is important for Everipedia’s platform to present accurate information. To make it easier for contributors and readers alike to see where editors get their information from (and the validity of those resources), it is important to cite their sources. This allows the community to check editors’ work and work with editors in an environment that is inherently collaborative. Do NOT: Use inappropriate topics: editors are supposed to create crypto-related content only. Plagiarise: publish content that is not your own and represent it as your work; this typically includes copying/pasting content without citing its original source and giving proper credit to the creator. It also includes violating copyright. Vandalize: deliberately attempt to add, change, or remove content to tarnish the page. Spam: reference content that attempts to promote irrelevant or inappropriate products to a page; these edit proposals tend to be in the form of advertisements and violate Everipedia’s policy of writing in an objective tone.
